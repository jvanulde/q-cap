# Code of Conduct

We strive to foster a welcoming, harassment‑free community for everyone—regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This Code applies to all project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, chats) and to public spaces when an individual is officially representing the project.

## Our Standards

### Examples of positive behavior
- Use inclusive, considerate language
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accept and offer constructive feedback gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy toward other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments
- Trolling, insults, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, doxxing, or publishing others’ private information
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards. They may remove, edit, or reject contributions not aligned with this Code, and may ban contributors temporarily or permanently for behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces and when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Report incidents to the maintainer. Complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly; the team will maintain confidentiality as much as possible.

### Enforcement Guidelines (summary)

When addressing violations, maintainers will consider impact and intent, and may apply one or more of the following:

1. **Correction** — A private, written warning with clarification of expected behavior.
2. **Warning** — A formal warning with consequences for continued behavior.
3. **Temporary Ban** — A temporary restriction from interaction or contribution.
4. **Permanent Ban** — A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
